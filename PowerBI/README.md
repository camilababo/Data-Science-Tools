# PowerBI for Data Analysis

This folder contains a fictional operational report for a Candy Store. 
The data was generated based on a [previous ranking of preferred candy for Halloween](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/the-ultimate-halloween-candy-power-ranking/) ([available on GitHub](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/candy-power-ranking/candy-data.csv)), by pre-processing relevant data and generating random order data with [mockaroo](https://mockaroo.com/). 
The final dataset can be accessed through [candy-data.xlsx](candy-data.xlsx) and the operational report can be accessed either in a .pbix file ([candy_store_powerbi_report.pbix](candy_store_powerbi_report.pbix)) or a extracted PDF presentation ([candy_store_report_presentation.pdf](candy_store_report_presentation.pdf)).
