This project contains scripts to query and extract information from a database created for a imaginary paper company, Parch and Posey.
The database can be access on [parch-and-posey.sql.txt](parch-and-posey.sql.txt) and was originally extracted from Udacity's SQL course ['SQL for Data Analysis'](https://www.udacity.com/course/sql-for-data-analysis--ud198), lectured by Derek Steer.
PostGreSQL was used to load the database and write the queries.
